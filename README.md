# RetDec IDA plugin

RetDec plugin for IDA (Interactive Disassembler).

The plugin is compatible with the following IDA versions: 7.x.
The plugin does NOT work with IDA 6.x, or freeware version of IDA 7.0.
The plugin binary itself is 64-bit, but at the moment, it supports only 32-bit address space. I.e. it works in `ida`, not `ida64`, and can decompile only 32-bit binaries.

## Installation and Use

Currently, we support only Windows and Linux.

### Windows

1. Either download and unpack a pre-built package from the following list, or build and install the RetDec IDA plugin by yourself (the process is described below):

    * [Windows - for 64-bit IDA](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/releases/download/v0.7/retdec-idaplugin-v0.7-windows.zip) (v0.7)

2. Follow the user guide (`user_guide.pdf`) that is part of the downloaded package, or use the [current version](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/blob/master/doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf) from this repository.

### Linux

1. Either download and unpack a pre-built package from the following list, or build and install the RetDec IDA plugin by yourself (the process is described below):

    * [Linux - for 64-bit IDA](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/releases/download/v0.7/retdec-idaplugin-v0.7-linux.zip) (v0.7)

2. Follow the user guide (`user_guide.pdf`) that is part of the downloaded package, or use the [current version](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/blob/master/doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf) from this repository.

## Build and Installation

### Requirements

**Note: These are requirements to build the RetDec IDA plugin, not to run it. See our [User Guide](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/blob/master/doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf) for information on plugin installation, configuration, and use.**

* A compiler supporting C++14
  * On Windows, only Microsoft Visual C++ is supported (version >= Visual Studio 2015).
* CMake (version >= 3.6)
* IDA SDK (version == 7.0)

### Process

* Clone the repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin.git`
* Linux:
  * `cd retdec-idaplugin`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DIDA_SDK_DIR=<path>`
  * `make`
  * `make install` (if `IDA_PATH` was set, see below)
* Windows:
  * Open a command prompt (e.g. `C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd` from [MSYS2](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/wiki/Windows-Environment))
  * `cd retdec-idaplugin`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DIDA_SDK_DIR=<path> -G<generator>`
  * `cmake --build . --config Release -- -m`
  * `cmake --build . --config Release --target install` (if `IDA_PATH` was set, see below)
  * Alternatively, you can open `retdec-idaplugin.sln` generated by `cmake` in Visual Studio IDE.

You must pass the following parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DIDA_SDK_DIR=</path/to/idasdk>` to tell `cmake` where the IDA SDK directory is located.
* (Windows only) `-G<generator>` is `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"` for 64-bit build using Visual Studio 2015. Later versions of Visual Studio may be used. Only 64-bit build is supported.

You can pass the following additional parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DIDA_PATH=</path/to/ida>` to tell `cmake` where to install the plugin. If specified, installation will copy plugin binary into `IDA_PATH/plugins`, and content of `scripts/idc` directory into `IDA_PATH/idc`. If not set, installation step does nothing.
* `-DRETDEC_IDAPLUGIN_DOC=ON` to enable the `user-guide` target which generates the user guide document (disabled by default, the target needs to be explicitly invoked).

## User Guide

The [User Guide](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/blob/master/doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf) in a PDF form is located in `doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf`.

You can build your own guide by enabling and invoking the `user-guide` target:
* `cmake .. -DRETDEC_IDAPLUGIN_DOC=ON`
* Linux: `make user-guide`
* Windows: `cmake --build . --config Release --target user-guide`
* Requires [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), LaTeX packages, and related tools.
* The resulting PDF will overwrite the original `user_guide.pdf` in `doc/user_guide`.
